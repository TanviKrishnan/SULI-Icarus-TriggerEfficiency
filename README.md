# SULI-Icarus-TriggerEfficiency

Group Presentations contains:
  - series of powerpoint presentations to:
    - SLAC Neutrino Group
    - ICARUS Trigger Working Group
    - Fellow SULI interns (Deliverables, Ignite Competition)

TriggerEfficiencyExploration_7232_ShiftedWindow.ipynb:
  - Trigger Efficiency Analysis Code for Run 7232 - contains both (-20µs, 0µs) and (-15µs, 5µs) emulation windows
  
TriggerEfficiencyExploration_MultiRun_AsymmetricWindow.ipynb:
  - Trigger Efficiency Analysis Code for Runs 8650 and 7232 - contains (-20µs, 0µs) emulation window for the East cryo and (-15µs, 5µs) emulation window for the West cryo
  - Can overlay efficiency plots from both runs, or analyze separately
  - Can add in new runs as well by following directions in comments
 
 All other folders:
  - contain plots created using the notebooks above - the category of plots in each folder is documented in the python notebooks.
